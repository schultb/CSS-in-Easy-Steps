<p>Massive acceleration - the forbidden fruit! It's easy to avoid such unlawful <img src="viper-front.png" alt="Viper Front"> activities in a normal vehicle. But there is an evil serpent; a Viper that tempts you to take a bite out of the asphalt. With a tasty 500-hp V10 powering a mere 3,300-lb roadster, the Dodge Viper SRT-10 tricks you into playing music with the loud pedal.</p>

<p>This car is too excessive, too epic for most people to use on a daily basis. <img src="viper-rear.png" alt="Viper Rear">But for otherwise nice couples who need only two seats  this is the car that will shame those who come up against them.</p>

<p class="clear">If you can afford to... Buy one. You'll like it.</p>
